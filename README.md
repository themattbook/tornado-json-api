# Tornado Archive JSON API

A RESTful API serving information on documented tornadoes in the United States from 1950-2007.

## Usage

The API is designed to parse JSON files as of today, but in the future will be more robust and contained within a MongoDB collection. To use, simply `npm start` and send a GET request to `localhost:5000/api/v1/:fileQuery`
